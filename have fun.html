	<h4 href="#">HALLOWEEN FUN!!!!</h4>
	<p>Halloween is a celebration on the night of October 31. It is most practised in the United States and Canada. Children wear costumes and go to people's homes saying "Trick or treat!" to ask for candy (sweets in the UK) and people give it to them. The suggestion is: "Give me a treat or I will play a trick on you." People mainly dress up as ghosts, witches, or other scary things for Halloween. 
For Christians it is the eve of All Saints' Day, which begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide. This covers the three days â€“ October 31 (All-Hallows Eve or Hallowe'en), November 1 (All Saints) and November 2 (All Souls). All Hallows' Eve is a Christianized feast influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, and pagan roots.</p>
